# Nonogram Solver
Work in progress fun dev project by Anthony Shinn

## Python
Implementing (partially) initially in Python in `solver.py` with various
other text tiles in form `test_.txt` and `solution_.txt` for input tests

## HTML/Javascript
Implementing also in JS/HTML for a more user centric approach to allow for
user input values on the browser, or to just play nonogram on the computer.
Done in `index.html`.
